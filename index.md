Hi!

Hope Schroeder here. I’m a PhD student at the [MIT Center for Constructive Communication](https://www.ccc.mit.edu/). I'm interested in how language technologies can help us investigate social phenomena and facilitate communication on major challenges in the world today. 

Get in touch if you want to talk about NLP, facilitated dialogue, AI in social research, or unique methods of understanding the media ecosystem.

**Recent updates (5/2025):**

* My piece, "Disclosure without Engagement," a paper reviewing positionality statements at FAccT 2018–2024, will be **presented at FAccT 2025**. This work stemmed from time with Solon Barocas on the Fairness, Accountability, Transparency, and Ethics in AI (FATE) team at Microsoft Research Labs in 2024, and Akshansh Pareek is also a collaborator. Pre-print hosted [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rEiNF26WRIChD0D4hGz_WrQ5WDZY2Heb/view?usp=sharing)!
* My piece with Deb Roy and Jad Kabbara on using LLMs in subjective annotation tasks, "Just put a human in the loop?", has been accepted to **ACL Findings 2025**, and will also be presented as a **talk at IC2S2**. Pre-print hosted [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1C3_q4dVz-lfds2ra9qVLOCN7MPE15lC6/view?usp=sharing)!
* I appeared at a symposium on AI in Social Science at APS 2025 in Washington DC with Nat Rabb, Tom Costello, and Ilia Sucholutsky!

* I shared three pieces of **accepted work** at CHI 2025:
  
  * My collaboration with Marianne Aubin Le Quéré on ["LLMs in Qualitative Research"](https://dl.acm.org/doi/full/10.1145/3706598.3713120)) was presented as a full paper
  * My collaboration with Doug Beeferman studying engagement with a RAG-based conversation sensemaking prototype is forthcoming as late-breaking work. We engaged NPR journalists and city government workers from The City of Durham, North Carolina as users! Try the prototype [here](http://forage.ccc-mit.org:8501/) and read the paper [here](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3706599.3719756)
  * A collaboration led by Rock Pang on ["Understanding the LLM-ification of CHI"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.12557) was presented as a full paper, stemming from work done at Microsoft Research Labs in 2024


**Some older updates:**
* "Fora: A corpus and framework for the study of facilitated dialogue" was presented at ACL 2024 Main Conference and IC2S2 2024. Learn more about the corpus [here](https://github.com/schropes/fora-corpus) and read the paper [here]([https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.754.pdf])!
* Our CHI 2024 workshop on [LLMs as Research Tools](https://sites.google.com/view/llmsindatawork/home) has led to follow-up work understanding LLMs in qualitative research.
* In June 2023, [Art and the Science of Generative AI](https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.adh4451), led by Ziv Epstein, came out as a Science Perspectives piece.
* In Spring 2023, I co-instructed a course on [Generative AI for Constructive Communication at MIT](https://ai4comm.media.mit.edu/).

## About Me
Before coming to MIT, I was a pre-doctoral fellow at Stanford Law School working with Professor Julian Nyarko on applications of NLP methods for legal and policy questions. Before that, I graduated with an MSc in [Social Data Science](https://www.oii.ox.ac.uk/study/msc-in-social-data-science/) (Distinction) at the [Oxford Internet Institute](https://www.oii.ox.ac.uk/) as a [Clarendon Scholar](http://www.ox.ac.uk/clarendon) at [Christ Church](https://www.chch.ox.ac.uk/). I was a 2019 graduate of Stanford in [Symbolic Systems](https://symsys.stanford.edu/) with honors. 

Before getting into data science, I worked on projects using VR & AR to document and reimagine contested areas of public space. Our [Magic Grant](https://brown.columbia.edu/propose/) project on a contested plaque [site at Stanford](https://www.dearvisitor.app/) received [global press](https://www.dearvisitor.app/press). A [case study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.02050) on this work received the Best Case Study Award at [CHI 2023](https://chi2023.acm.org/)!
