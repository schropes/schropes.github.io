Hi!

Hope Schroeder here. Iâ€™m a PhD student at the [MIT Center for Constructive Communication](https://www.ccc.mit.edu/). I'm interested in how language technologies can help us investigate social phenomena and facilitate communication on major challenges in the world today. 

Get in touch if you want to talk about NLP, facilitated dialogue, AI in social research, or unique methods of understanding the media ecosystem.

Some recent updates (10/2024):
* I'm back at MIT for Fall 2024 after interning at Microsoft Research Labs in New York City with Solon Barocas on the Fairness, Accountability, Transparency, and Ethics in AI (FATE) team during the summer. Our project evaluating opportunities, risks, and trade-offs of LLMs in inductive text analysis is forthcoming.
* I'll be presenting my work on the impacts of LLM-assisted text annotation at [Computation + Journalism](https://idi.provost.northeastern.edu/event-directory/the-2024-computation-journalism-symposium/) at Northeastern on October 26th, 2024. 
* "Fora: A corpus and framework for the study of facilitated dialogue" was presented at ACL 2024 Main Conference and IC2S2 2024. Learn more about the corpus [here](https://github.com/schropes/fora-corpus) and read the paper [here]([https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.754.pdf])!
* Our CHI 2024 workshop on [LLMs as Research Tools](https://sites.google.com/view/llmsindatawork/home) has led to follow-up work understanding LLMs in qualitative research.

Some older updates:
* In Summer 2023, I worked at Microsoft Research Labs' Computational Social Science team under David Rothschild, investigating the use of LLMs for news polling and understanding. Paper forthcoming!
* In June 2023, [Art and the Science of Generative AI](https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.adh4451) came out as a Science Perspectives piece.
* In Spring 2023, I co-instructed a course on [Generative AI for Constructive Communication at MIT](https://ai4comm.media.mit.edu/).

A few computational creativity projects: 
A fun paper I published with [Ziv Epstein](http://zive.info/) and Dava Newman, [When happy accidents spark creativity: Bringing collaborative speculation to life with generative AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.00533), was published in [ICCC '22](http://computationalcreativity.net/iccc22/). I contributed to the [AI Alchemy Lab series](http://aialchemy.media.mit.edu/) at the MIT Media Lab exploring generative AI in the creative process, and a [paper](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=wm0WZPnhTC) from this stream of work appeared at [AAAI 2023's first workshop on CreativeAI](https://creativeai-ws.github.io/). 

## About Me
Before coming to MIT, I was a pre-doctoral fellow at Stanford Law School working with Professor Julian Nyarko on applications of NLP methods for legal and policy questions. Before that, I graduated with an MSc in [Social Data Science](https://www.oii.ox.ac.uk/study/msc-in-social-data-science/) (Distinction) at the [Oxford Internet Institute](https://www.oii.ox.ac.uk/) as a [Clarendon Scholar](http://www.ox.ac.uk/clarendon) at [Christ Church](https://www.chch.ox.ac.uk/). I was a 2019 graduate of Stanford in [Symbolic Systems](https://symsys.stanford.edu/) with honors. 

Before getting into data science, I worked on projects using VR & AR to document and reimagine contested areas of public space. Our [Magic Grant](https://brown.columbia.edu/propose/) project on a contested plaque [site at Stanford](https://www.dearvisitor.app/) received [global press](https://www.dearvisitor.app/press). A [case study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.02050) on this work received the Best Case Study Award at [CHI 2023](https://chi2023.acm.org/)!
