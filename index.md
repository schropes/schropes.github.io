Hi!

Hope Schroeder here. Iâ€™m a PhD student at the [MIT Center for Constructive Communication](https://www.ccc.mit.edu/). I'm interested in how NLP methods can help us investigate social phenomena and facilitate communication on major challenges in the world today. 

Get in touch if you want to talk about generative AI, facilitated dialog, or unique methods of understanding the media ecosystem.

Some recent updates (2/2024):
* Submit to our workshop at CHI 2024 on LLMs for Data Work, due 2/22/24! Details [here](https://sites.google.com/view/llmsindatawork/home)!
* In Summer 2023, I worked at Microsoft Research Labs' Computational Social Science team under David Rothschild, investigating the use of LLMs for news polling and understanding. Paper forthcoming!
* In June 2023, [Art and the Science of Generative AI](https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.adh4451) came out as a Science Perspectives piece.
* In Spring 2023, I co-instructed a course on [Generative AI for Constructive Communication at MIT](https://ai4comm.media.mit.edu/).

A few computational creativity projects: 
A fun paper I published with [Ziv Epstein](http://zive.info/) and Dava Newman, [When happy accidents spark creativity: Bringing collaborative speculation to life with generative AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.00533), was published in [ICCC '22](http://computationalcreativity.net/iccc22/). I contributed to the [AI Alchemy Lab series](http://aialchemy.media.mit.edu/) at the MIT Media Lab exploring generative AI in the creative process, and a [paper](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=wm0WZPnhTC) from this stream of work appeared at [AAAI 2023's first workshop on CreativeAI](https://creativeai-ws.github.io/). 

## About Me
Before coming to MIT, I was a pre-doctoral fellow at Stanford Law School working with Professor Julian Nyarko on applications of NLP methods for legal and policy questions. Before that, I graduated with an MSc in [Social Data Science](https://www.oii.ox.ac.uk/study/msc-in-social-data-science/) (Distinction) at the [Oxford Internet Institute](https://www.oii.ox.ac.uk/) as a [Clarendon Scholar](http://www.ox.ac.uk/clarendon) at [Christ Church](https://www.chch.ox.ac.uk/). I was a 2019 graduate of Stanford in [Symbolic Systems](https://symsys.stanford.edu/) with honors. 

Before getting into data science, I worked on projects using VR & AR to document and reimagine contested areas of public space. Our [Magic Grant](https://brown.columbia.edu/propose/) project on a contested plaque [site at Stanford](https://www.dearvisitor.app/) received [global press](https://www.dearvisitor.app/press). A [case study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.02050) on this work received the Best Case Study Award at [CHI 2023](https://chi2023.acm.org/)!
