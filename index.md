Hi!

Hope Schroeder here. Iâ€™m a first-year graduate student in the [MIT Center for Constructive Communication](https://www.ccc.mit.edu/) and I work with language and network data. I'm interested in how emerging computational methods can help us investigate cultural, social, and political phenomena and inform action on major challenges in the world today. 

A fun recent paper I published with [Ziv Epstein](http://zive.info/) and Dava Newman, [When happy accidents spark creativity: Bringing collaborative speculation to life with generative AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.00533), was published in [ICCC '22](http://computationalcreativity.net/iccc22/).

Before coming to MIT, I was a pre-doctoral fellow at Stanford Law School working with Professor Julian Nyarko on applications of NLP methods for legal and policy questions. Before that, I was an MSc student in [Social Data Science](https://www.oii.ox.ac.uk/study/msc-in-social-data-science/) at the [Oxford Internet Institute](https://www.oii.ox.ac.uk/), [Clarendon Scholar](http://www.ox.ac.uk/clarendon) at [Christ Church](https://www.chch.ox.ac.uk/), and 2019 graduate of Stanford in [Symbolic Systems](https://symsys.stanford.edu/) with honors. 

Before getting into data science, I worked on projects using VR & AR to document and reimagine contested areas of public space. Our project on a contested plaque [site at Stanford](https://www.dearvisitor.app/) received [global press](https://www.dearvisitor.app/press).
