Hi!

Hope Schroeder here.

I'm interested in how emerging technology can help us investigate or solve some major challenges in the world today.

I'm an incoming MSc student in [Social Data Science](https://www.oii.ox.ac.uk/study/msc-in-social-data-science/) at the [Oxford Internet Institute](https://www.oii.ox.ac.uk/), [Clarendon Scholar](http://www.ox.ac.uk/clarendon) at [Christ Church college](https://www.chch.ox.ac.uk/), and recent graduate of Stanford in [Symbolic Systems](https://symsys.stanford.edu/).

Currently, I'm working on a couple of projects using AR to reimagine contested areas of public space. We are working on a contested plaque [site at Stanford](https://www.dearvisitor.app/) and Confederate monuments in [Charleston](https://brown.columbia.edu/portfolio/charleston-reconstructed/). 

I've worked on other immersive journalism projects like [this one](http://peninsulapress.com/2017/04/18/california-climate-360-video-story/) about climate in the Sierras and [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBKLH2bHdcE) about the New Year's traditions of Bali. 

Here's a vignette from my forthcoming project about the art on the Berlin Wall, Belfast peace walls, and US-Mexico border wall, [Paint Down the Wall](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4JHOiridw0), which was [featured in VentureBeat](https://venturebeat.com/2018/05/09/4-ar-vr-stanford-student-projects-show-the-future-of-immersive-tech/). 

Data science, NLP, and gender research are other areas in which I work. Recent projects from this space are forthcoming!
