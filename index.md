Hi!

Hope Schroeder here.

I'm at Stanford studying [Symbolic Systems](https://symsys.stanford.edu/), a blend of cognitive science and computer science.

I'm interested in how emerging technology can help us investigate or solve some major challenges in the world today.

You may know me from [Rabbit Hole VR](https://www.rabbitholevr.org/)
, Stanford's AR/VR community.

I work on immersive journalism projects like [this one](http://peninsulapress.com/2017/04/18/california-climate-360-video-story/) about climate in the Sierras and [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBKLH2bHdcE) about the New Year's traditions of Bali. 

Here's a vignette from my forthcoming project about the art on the Berlin Wall, Belfast peace walls, and US-Mexico border wall, [Paint Down the Wall](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4JHOiridw0), which was [featured](https://venturebeat.com/2018/05/09/4-ar-vr-stanford-student-projects-show-the-future-of-immersive-tech/) in VentureBeat. 

I'm also working on a project about how AR can help us reimagine contested areas of public space like monuments. We are focusing on a site at Stanford and [Charleston](https://brown.columbia.edu/portfolio/charleston-reconstructed/). 

Language, data, and gender research are other areas in which I work. Recent projects from this space are forthcoming!
