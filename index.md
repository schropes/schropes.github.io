Hi!

Hope Schroeder here. Iâ€™m a PhD student at the [MIT Center for Constructive Communication](https://www.ccc.mit.edu/). I'm interested in how NLP methods can help us investigate social phenomena and facilitate communication on major challenges in the world today. 

In the last year, I've presented work at [IC2S2](https://iscss.org/ic2s2/conference/), [AAAI's CreativeAI workshop](https://creativeai-ws.github.io/), [TADA](https://tada2022.org/), [ICCC](https://computationalcreativity.net/iccc22/), [WiBD](https://www.wibd.ch/), [Computation+Journalism](https://cj2022.brown.columbia.edu/), and [EMNLP's WiNLP workshop](https://www.winlp.org/).

A fun recent paper I published with [Ziv Epstein](http://zive.info/) and Dava Newman, [When happy accidents spark creativity: Bringing collaborative speculation to life with generative AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.00533), was published in [ICCC '22](http://computationalcreativity.net/iccc22/). I've also contributed to the [AI Alchemy Lab series](http://aialchemy.media.mit.edu/) at the Media Lab this fall exploring generative AI in the creative process, and a [paper](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=wm0WZPnhTC) from this stream of work appeared at [AAAI 2023's first workshop on CreativeAI](https://creativeai-ws.github.io/). 

This semester (Spring 2023) I am leading a course on [Generative AI for Constructive Communication at MIT](https://ai4comm.media.mit.edu/).

Before coming to MIT, I was a pre-doctoral fellow at Stanford Law School working with Professor Julian Nyarko on applications of NLP methods for legal and policy questions. Before that, I was an MSc student in [Social Data Science](https://www.oii.ox.ac.uk/study/msc-in-social-data-science/) at the [Oxford Internet Institute](https://www.oii.ox.ac.uk/), [Clarendon Scholar](http://www.ox.ac.uk/clarendon) at [Christ Church](https://www.chch.ox.ac.uk/), and 2019 graduate of Stanford in [Symbolic Systems](https://symsys.stanford.edu/) with honors. 

Before getting into data science, I worked on projects using VR & AR to document and reimagine contested areas of public space. Our [Magic Grant](https://brown.columbia.edu/propose/) project on a contested plaque [site at Stanford](https://www.dearvisitor.app/) received [global press](https://www.dearvisitor.app/press). A case study on this work is forthcoming at [CHI 2023](https://chi2023.acm.org/), a preprint of which can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.02050).
