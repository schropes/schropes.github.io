Hi!

Hope Schroeder here.

I'm interested in how emerging technology can help us investigate or solve major challenges in the world today.

I'm an MSc student in [Social Data Science](https://www.oii.ox.ac.uk/study/msc-in-social-data-science/) at the [Oxford Internet Institute](https://www.oii.ox.ac.uk/), [Clarendon Scholar](http://www.ox.ac.uk/clarendon) at [Christ Church](https://www.chch.ox.ac.uk/), and 2019 graduate of Stanford in [Symbolic Systems](https://symsys.stanford.edu/). 

My master's thesis is an inter-disciplinary computational analysis of messaging networks in India and Indonesia from last year's elections. My undergraduate honors thesis used NLP techniques to analyze gender bias in a major technology company's performance evaluations.

I also work on projects using AR to reimagine contested areas of public space. Our project on a contested plaque [site at Stanford](https://www.dearvisitor.app/) received [global press](https://www.dearvisitor.app/press). Our other project about Confederate monuments in [Charleston](https://www.charlestonreconstructed.com/) is launching soon.
